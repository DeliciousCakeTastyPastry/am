i can probably write that direct string via query
select option_name, option_value from wp_options where option_name="disable_comments_options";
to the database to turn on the option....

how to test:
do fresh install, extract string
set options, extract string
compare strings, will be different surely
then do fresh install
set options again, see if string matches again, they should
then do fresh install, directly edit string via mysql
see if functionality is changed...
